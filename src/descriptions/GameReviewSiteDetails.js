        <p>This website is being developed as a part of <em>SENG365</em>, Web Computing Architectures.</p>

        <p>This project is being completed in two separately assessed halves, backend and frontend. The backend was a RESTful API written in <strong>TypeScript</strong> using <strong>Node.js</strong> with <strong>Express</strong> and tested with <strong>Bruno</strong>. The database was managed with <strong>MySQL</strong>. The code for the backend can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/AlexWilsonSoftware/GameReviewSiteBackend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. </p>

        <p>Development of the frontend is currently in progress, using <strong>React</strong>. I am yet to finish development of the frontend. My GitHub, and this article, will be updated once it is complete.</p>
